# js_VoxelTerrainTest

Just an experiment in creating and rendering very simple voxel-based terrain
with JavaScript and THREE.js.

## TODO:

### Phase 1
* Create a 64x64x64 cube of terrain from 3d perlin noise
* Create naive tesselator to generate mesh from terrain array
* Render it!

### Phase 2
* Learn enough about GLSL to write a shader that applies different textures
  based on the noise value for the voxel.
